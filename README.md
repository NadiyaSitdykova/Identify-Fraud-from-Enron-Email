# P5: Identify Fraud from Enron Email
Enron fraud detection using financial data and emails (Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree project for Machine Learning course).

### Short questions

*Question 1: Summarize for us the goal of this project and how machine learning is useful in trying to accomplish it. As part of your answer, give some background on the dataset and how it can be used to answer the project question. Were there any outliers in the data when you got it, and how did you handle those?*

*Question 2: What features did you end up using in your POI identifier, and what selection process did you use to pick them? Did you have to do any scaling? Why or why not? As part of the assignment, you should attempt to engineer your own feature that does not come ready-made in the dataset -- explain what feature you tried to make, and the rationale behind it.*

*Question 3: What algorithm did you end up using? What other one(s) did you try? How did model performance differ between algorithms?*

*Question 4: What does it mean to tune the parameters of an algorithm, and what can happen if you don’t do this well?  How did you tune the parameters of your particular algorithm? What parameters did you tune?*

*Question 5: What is validation, and what’s a classic mistake you can make if you do it wrong? How did you validate your analysis?*

*Question 6: Give at least 2 evaluation metrics and your average performance for each of them.  Explain an interpretation of your metrics that says something human-understandable about your algorithm’s performance.*
